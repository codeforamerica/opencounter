          <h1>The Big Picture</h1>
          <p>Here's how to start a business in the City of Santa Cruz.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>First, secure a <strong>use permit</strong> from the City&rsquo;s Planning Department. If you&rsquo;re starting a business, even if you're working from home, the City has to approve that use in your location. <a href="#">Skip to use permit helper &rarr;</a></li>
            <li>Next, if you&rsquo;re doing any renovations or tenant improvements, get approval from the City of Santa Cruz Building Department. <a href="#">Skip to building permit helper &rarr;</a></li>
            <li>Finally, obtain a <strong>business license</strong> from the City of Santa Cruz Finance Department. <a href="#">Skip to business license &rarr;</a></li>
          </ol>
          <p>While that covers most City processes, there are also county, regional, state, and federal regulations that may apply to your business. We&rsquo;ve included tools to help you research and fulfill those requirements, too.</p>

A home occupation shall be operated and maintained only by a resident of the dwelling unit in which it occurs; shall not employ any help other than the members of the resident family or household; shall not change the residential character of the dwelling units; shall not generate a vehicular traffic increase of more than six trip ends (three round trips) per day including deliveries and clients.</li>

          <h1>Siting Your Business</h1>
          <p>If you&rsquo;re not working out of your home, you will need to pick a location that is zoned to allow businesses like yours to operate.</p>
          <h3>Zoning</h3>
          <p>Zoning laws limit the types of businesses that can operate within a particular area.</p>
          <p>Why? By clustering types of businesses, we can help preserve neighborhoods and share services.</p>
          <p>Think of it this way: zoning makes sure a rubber factory can&rsquo;t open next to a preschool.</p>
          <p>In Santa Cruz, all zones are defined by title 24 of the City&rsquo;s municipal code.</p>
          <h3>Use &amp; Prior Use</h3>
          <p>A good tip for finding a location that permits your use is to pick a space with a prior use as similar to yours as possible.</p>
          <p>This will make it more likely that your use will be approved.</p>
          <p>If the past use matches your use, the zoning will match and parking will likely not be an issue.</p>
          <p>For example, if you are opening a restaurant, try to go into a space that previously held a restaurant.</p>

          <h1>Use Permit</h1>
          
          <p>The type of use permit your business needs depends on whether and how your zoning district permits your use.</p>
          
          <h3 class="toggle">Principally Permitted Uses</h3>
          <div class="drawer">
            <p>If the zoning code specifically allows your type of business to operate at the site you chose, great!</p>
            <p>All you need is a Zoning Clearance. This is the simplest form of a use permit, and is typically issued the same day, with minimal review.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h3 class="toggle">Non-Principally Permitted Uses</h3>
          <div class="drawer">
            <p>If your use is not principally permitted, you will need either an Administrative Use Permit or a Special Use Permit.</p>
            <p>Administrative Use Permit (<abbr title="Administrative Use Permit">AUP</abbr>): This kind of application requires more staff analysis, and more information from the applicant. These permits entail a public hearing before the Zoning Administrator, and can take approximately 6-8 weeks to work their way through to completion.</p>
            <p>Special Use Permit (<abbr title="Special Use Permit">SUP</abbr>): Requires a high level of scrutiny, typically due to the size of the project and its impact on the neighborhood. These applications go to Planning Commission, whose decision is ratified by the City Council. SUPs take 2-3 months.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h3 class="toggle">Prohibited Uses</h3>
          <div class="drawer">
            <p>If your use is explicitly prohibited, you should probably choose a different site for your business.</p>
            <p>The alternative, changing the zoning for that property, is very difficult, rare, and can take years. It is not recommended, but you are welcome to <a href="#">contact the Planning Department</a> for more information.</p>

          <h3>Fictitious Business Names (or, what&rsquo;s in a name?)</h3>
          <p>If the name of your business does not contain your last name, you will need to apply to Santa Cruz County for a Fictitious Business Name (FBN).</p>
          <p>For example, if your last name is Smith and your business is called "Smith&rsquo;s Tanning," you won't need an FBN. But if your business is called "Eastside Tanning," you will need an FBN.</p>
