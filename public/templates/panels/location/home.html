  <h1>Working From Home</h1>
  
  <p>You can work from home as long as you're not negatively impacting the neighborhood by increasing visitors or traffic, creating a lot of noise, or working with hazardous materials. You also can't have a sign on your home advertising the business.</p>
  <p>More precisely: work-from-home businesses &mdash; known as "home occupations" &mdash; need to follow the rules outlined in section <a href="http://www.codepublishing.com/CA/SantaCruz/html/SantaCruz24/SantaCruz2410.html#24.10.160">24.10.160</a> of the city of Santa Cruz's Municipal Code.</p>
  <h3 class="toggle">Read Santa Cruz Municipal Code 24.10.160 <br>It won't take long! We'll wait.</h3>
  <blockquote class="drawer">
    <ol>
      <li>Intent. The discretionary approval of a home occupation is intended to allow for home enterprises, which are clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling unit and compatible with surrounding residential uses. A home occupation allows for the gainful employment in the home by any occupant of a dwelling so long as the enterprise does not require frequent customer access or have associated characteristics which would reduce the surrounding residents? enjoyment of their neighborhood.</li>
      <li>General. A home occupation shall be operated and maintained only by a resident of the dwelling unit in which it occurs; shall not employ any help other than the members of the resident family or household; shall not change the residential character of the dwelling units; shall not generate a vehicular traffic increase of more than six trip ends (three round trips) per day including deliveries and clients.</li>
      <li>Restrictions. A home occupation shall not involve:
        <ol>
          <li>The use of an area greater than four hundred feet;</li>
          <li>The use of any required front or exterior side yard area or setback area, nor the use of any required covered or uncovered on-site parking space;</li>
          <li>Any activity or use which involves:
            <ol>
              <li>A significant increase in vehicular trips to the residence;</li>
              <li>Storage or use of hazardous or unsanitary materials;</li>
              <li>Creation of noise levels exceeding the standards of this title and/or other nuisance factors inconsistent with Chapter 24.14, Part 2: Performance Standards;</li>
              <li>Auto/truck/motorcycle/motor boat repair.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>The location is in a residential or mixed use zoning district</li>
          <li>The placement of a sign advertising the business.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Permits Required. A zoning clearance and business license shall be required, except for small family day care which is exempt from local regulations.</li>
