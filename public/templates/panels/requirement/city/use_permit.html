  <h1>Use Permit</h1>
  
  <p>The type of use permit your business needs depends on whether and how your zoning district permits your use.</p>
  
  <h3 class="toggle">Principally Permitted Uses</h3>
  <div class="drawer">
    <p>If the zoning code specifically allows your type of business to operate at the site you chose, great!</p>
    <p>All you need is a Zoning Clearance. This is the simplest form of a use permit, and is typically issued the same day, with minimal review.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="toggle">Non-Principally Permitted Uses</h3>
  <div class="drawer">
    <p>If your use is not principally permitted, you will need either an Administrative Use Permit or a Special Use Permit.</p>
    <p>Administrative Use Permit (<abbr title="Administrative Use Permit">AUP</abbr>): This kind of application requires more staff analysis, and more information from the applicant. These permits entail a public hearing before the Zoning Administrator, and can take approximately 6-8 weeks to work their way through to completion.</p>
    <p>Special Use Permit (<abbr title="Special Use Permit">SUP</abbr>): Requires a high level of scrutiny, typically due to the size of the project and its impact on the neighborhood. These applications go to Planning Commission, whose decision is ratified by the City Council. SUPs take 2-3 months.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h3 class="toggle">Prohibited Uses</h3>
  <div class="drawer">
    <p>If your use is explicitly prohibited, you should probably choose a different site for your business.</p>
    <p>The alternative, changing the zoning for that property, is very difficult, rare, and can take years. It is not recommended, but you are welcome to <a href="#">contact the Planning Department</a> for more information.</p>
