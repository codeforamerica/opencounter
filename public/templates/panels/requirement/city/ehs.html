  <h1>Environmental Health &amp; Safety Permits</h1>

  <p>If you sell any kind of food or beverage in the State of California, you must do so in a safe and clean environment. The people that ensure that this happens is the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency.</p>
  <p>Working in conjunction with the City's Planning Department, they will make sure that your floors are non-slip, your ingredients are properly stored at the right temperature, and your meals are fully cooked. The rates that they charge for this service vary on the type of business you are and the square footage that you are operating in.</p>
  <p>You've told us this already, so we're well on our way to getting these forms done.</p>
  <p>Your planner will help you with more details about this process, including how the they will check your plans and how you and your employees with register for training to make sure that all food handling is done in a safe and responsible manner.</p>
  

  <p>The rules for health and safety are called the California Retail Food Code, and you can find them <a href="http://sccounty01.co.santa-cruz.ca.us/eh/consumer_protection/CRFC.pdf">online here</a>.
