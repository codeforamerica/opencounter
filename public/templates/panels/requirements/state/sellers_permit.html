  <p>Earlier in this guide, you&rsquo;ve told us that your business will sell things to the public. This means that the State of California would like you to register for a “seller&rsquo;s permit.” This registration is required for anyone who engages in “retail sales of tangible personal property.” Typically this means all clothing, housewares or other items that is sold directly to the public. This permit registers your business as a point of sale, and imports your information into the state&rsquo;s taxation database. Sales tax is due quarterly to the state, and a portion of your sales tax stays within the community to pay for the services your shop will use, like policy and fire protection, city administration and services for small businesses.</p>
  <p>The current sales tax rate in the City of Santa Cruz is 8.5%.</p>
  <p>There is no upfront charge for the permit (unless you have unpaid taxes due to the state), but the State Board of Equalization may require a deposit. This deposit is used to cover any unpaid taxes that may be owed if the business closes. We&rsquo;ve included some links below if you&rsquo;d like to learn more. The BOE&rsquo;s helpline is 800-400-7115. Much of the data the state needs you've already told us, but there are a few remaining questions. At the end of your session, we'll get you a summary of how to file for this permit.</p>
