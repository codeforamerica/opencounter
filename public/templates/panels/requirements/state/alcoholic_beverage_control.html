  <p>Earlier in this guide, you've told us that your business will sell alcohol.
  <p>This process involves not only the City's Police Department and Planning and Community Development staff, but also the State's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Securing an ABC permit will take some time and the information that the ABC asks for is both detailed and extensive, including your  business' layout, your employment and financial history and other personal details.
  <p>This guide will help you complete your application questionnaire, which will be required of anyone who would like to get a permit from the ABC.
  <p>Your contact in the Planning Department will help you with preparing many of the documents that will come later, including the layout of your business and hours of operation, as well as other conditions that the City will ask for during the permitting process.
