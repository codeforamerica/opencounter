  <h1>Waste Water Discharge</h1>
  <p>This permit is required for food and manufacturing users or any business whose operations place a greater demand on City waste water facilities. The City normally requres this permit from these kinds of businesses:</p>
  
<ul>
<li>Categorical processes or operations as defined by federal regulations </li>
<li>An average wastewater flow of 25,000 gallons per day </li>
<li>A concentrated waste flow</li>
<li>Dry cleaning operations </li>
<li>Groundwater extraction and treatment operations</li>
<li>Potential to have an adverse affect on wastewater workers, the wastewater collection system, or the wastewater treatment plant</li>

</ul>

<p>There are no application or permit fees, and your planner will help you get this form sorted as you do your tenant improvements and go through the building process.</p>

<p>Wastewater discharge permits are typically issued for a period of three years. The City may issue a permit for a period less than three years or one that expires on a specific date. A permit may not be reassigned, transferred, or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises or a new or changed operation. </p>
