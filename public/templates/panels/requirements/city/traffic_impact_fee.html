  <h1>Traffic Impact Fee</h1>
  <p> A gym has a more "intense use"; than a warehouse. This means more more people will utilize the public space and put a greater strain on the surrounding roads and public infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Here are some businesses listed from light to intense use: Warehouse &lt; Shoe store &lt; Restaurant &lt; Gym</p>
<p>This is a complicated concept. In California, it is your responsibility to mitigate the impact of changes of use if the “intensity” of use increases. This means accounting for more traffic, parking and people using the space.</p>

<p>If your business has a higher traffic need than your space allows it is your responsibility to pay into a fund that helps traffic improvements. This is done by a one time charge called Traffic Impact Fee (TIF). TIF helps pay for things like wider lanes and signalized intersections. This fee can be $1,000 to $200,000.</p>
<p>The fee is based on the number of trips your use generates minus any credit for what the previous use had.  Here is a tool that helps estimate the fee: </p>
