  <p class="lead">A gym has a more &#8220;intense use&#8221; than a warehouse. This means more more people will utilize the public space and put a greater strain on the surrounding roads and public infrastructure.</p>
  <p>Here are some businesses listed from light to intense use: Warehouse &lt; Shoe store &lt; Restaurant &lt; Gym</p>
  <p>This is a complicated concept. In California, it's our responsibility to mitigate the impact of changes of use if the "intensity" of use increases. This means accounting for more traffic, parking and people using the space.</p>
