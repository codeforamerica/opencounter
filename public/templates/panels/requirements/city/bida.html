(Business Area X Rate [.34] X Type X Zone) + $50.00 = Annual Assessment
Annual Assessment / 2 = Semi-Annual Assessment

Calculation Example: 
(1,000 Sq Ft) x .34 x 100% (Type 1) x 60% (Zone 2) + $50.00 = $236.00 / 2 = $118.00 Semi-Annual Assessment

TYPE 1 - 100%	 RETAIL & FOOD
TYPE 2 - 60%	 FINANCIAL, BARS & THEATERS
TYPE 3 - 40%	 WHOLESALE TRADE, SERVICES & PROFESSIONS, AUTO DEALERS

ZONE 1 - 100%	 CAP OF 10,000 SQ FT (Pacific Avenue Addresses and within one block of it on side street. Best to probably ask as a yes / no question)
ZONE 2 - 60%	 CAP OF 10,000 SQ FT (
