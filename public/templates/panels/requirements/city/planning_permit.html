    <h4>Is your use principally permitted?<br>You need a zoning clearance.</h4>
    <p>If the zoning code specifically allows your type of business to operate at the site you chose, great!</p>
    <p>All you need is a Zoning Clearance. This is the simplest form of a planning permit, and is typically issued the same day, with minimal review.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="span4">
    <h4>Is your use not principally permitted?<br>You need a use permit.</h4>
    <p>If your use is not principally permitted, you will need either an Administrative Use Permit or a Special Use Permit. These kind of permits require a public hearing.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Administrative Use Permit (<abbr title="Administrative Use Permit">AUP</abbr>)</dt>
      <dd>This kind of application requires more staff analysis, and more information from the applicant. These permits entail a public hearing before the Zoning Administrator, and can take approximately 8-10 weeks to work their way through to completion. This public hearing is before the Zoning Administrator, a planning professional.</dd>
      <dt>Special Use Permit (<abbr title="Special Use Permit">SUP</abbr>)</dt>
      <dd>Requires a high level of scrutiny, typically due to the size of the project and its impact on the neighborhood. These applications go to Planning Commission, a panel of seven City Council appointees who meet twice a month. SUPs take 8-12 weeks.</dd>

    <h4>Is your use prohibited?<br>Choose a different location.</h4>
    <p>If your use is explicitly prohibited, you should probably choose a different site for your business.</p>

    <p>The alternative, changing the zoning for that property, is very difficult, rare, and can take years. It is not recommended, but you are welcome to <a href="/help">contact the Planning Department</a> for more information.</p>
