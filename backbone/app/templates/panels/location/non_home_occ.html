  <h1>Siting Your Business</h1>
  <p>If you&rsquo;re not working out of your home, you will need to pick a location that is zoned to allow businesses like yours to operate.</p>
  <h3>Zoning</h3>
  <p>Zoning laws limit the types of businesses that can operate within a particular area.</p>
  <p>Why? By clustering types of businesses, we can help preserve neighborhoods and share services.</p>
  <p>Think of it this way: zoning makes sure a rubber factory can&rsquo;t open next to a preschool.</p>
  <p>In Santa Cruz, all zones are defined by title 24 of the City&rsquo;s municipal code.</p>
  <h3>Use &amp; Prior Use</h3>
  <p>A good tip for finding a location that permits your use is to pick a space with a prior use as similar to yours as possible.</p>
  <p>This will make it more likely that your use will be approved.</p>
  <p>If the past use matches your use, the zoning will match and parking will likely not be an issue.</p>
  <p>For example, if you are opening a restaurant, try to go into a space that previously held a restaurant.</p>
